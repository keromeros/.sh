A repository to store all my simple bash scripts that are created for fun or to just help out friends.

I am in no way a professional bash programmer and there might be allot better ways to do the things i do here on my scripts but if they in any way help anybody feel free to use them.

CF - Folder contains a pair of scripts that are to be run on a raspberry pi using the default raspbian and/or could probably work on any other bash terminal or linux distro
